# countinmultiples

Count along to your multiple of choice!

An interactive web tool to practise counting in multiples. I originally created
it whilst volunteering for a primary school&#8217;s &#8216;Maths Mountain&#8217;
program which aims to help children become more secure in
[times tables](https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/search?q=times+tables)
and
[number bonds](https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/search?q=number+bonds).

I wrote the code in vanilla
[JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)
(with
[HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_intro.asp) and
[CSS 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS))
as a personal learning exercise and more
recently updated it for
[ECMAScript 6](https://www.codecademy.com/article/javascript-versions).

The code is &#8216;vanilla&#8217; in the sense of plain, i.e. with no
dependence on JavaScript frameworks.
